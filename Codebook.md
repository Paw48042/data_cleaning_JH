### Any variable follow with std = Standard deviation of each activity
  #### - if follow with X,Y, or Z means that it's a standard daviation of that activity, 
  #### for example "time.GravityAcc.std...X" "time.GravityAcc.std...Y" "time.GravityAcc.std...Z" means that it's a std of time.GravityAcc in each axis(X,Y,Z)
